# Pet Food Calculator

this application will  suggest a daily volume or  to feed. 
It will guide pet owners in long-term weight management by letting owners set a target weight 
and track their pet's weight progression over time. The obesity epidemic, affecting over half of cats and dogs in NA,
 is a major health concern in small animal medicine. This application can empower pet owners to understand their pet's
 nutritional needs and maintain healthy weights.
