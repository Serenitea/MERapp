# Pet Food Calculator

## Weight Management and Feeding Calculator for Cats & Dogs

Given the weight, age, and lifestyle needs of a cat or dog and the nutritional density of their diets, 
this application will suggest a daily volume or weight to feed that is appropriate for maintaining their weight. 
It will guide pet owners in long-term weight management by letting owners set a target weight 
and track their pet's weight progression over time. The obesity epidemic, affecting over half of cats and dogs in NA,
 is a major health concern in small animal medicine. This application can empower pet owners to understand their pet's
 nutritional needs and maintain healthy weights.
