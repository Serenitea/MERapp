# Pet Food Calculator

## Weight Management and Feeding Calculator for Cats & Dogs

Given the weight, age, and lifestyle needs of a cat or dog and the nutritional density of their diets, 
this application will suggest a daily volume or weight to feed that is appropriate for maintaining their weight. 
It will guide pet owners in long-term weight management by letting owners set a target weight 
and track their pet's weight progression over time. The obesity epidemic, affecting over half of cats and dogs in NA,
 is a major health concern in small animal medicine. This application can empower pet owners to understand their pet's
 nutritional needs and maintain healthy weights.
 
 ##User Stories for phase 1:
 - add a new pet with basic traits with name, age, breed, sex, and weight.
 - view current list of pets
 - Edit pets
 - select a pet, add a diet for them and have the app recommend a feeding amount.
 - output recommended feeding amount

 
 
### *Todo wishlist:*
 - input and store a pet's current weight with an attached date
 - *feeding history*
 - *user profiles*
 - *edit weight history*
 - *more options for diet caloric measurements - kcalPerKg*
 - *imperial measurement conversions*
 - *expand on diet traits - e.g. fields for brand, wet/dry, etc.*

During each phase of the term project, 
you will write user stories
\ that describe how someone can use your 
application to produce a specific outcome.  
You will then design the code necessary to make 
that user story a reality in your application. 

Note that in each of these sample applications, there is at least one user story that involves adding multiple Xs 
to a Y (e.g. adding an item to a to-do list) where X and Y are classes that you must design yourself (so Y cannot be of 
type `ArrayList<E>` for example). By*multiple*, we mean that it will not be sufficient to always add a fixed 
X to a Y but this must be a dynamic process (i.e. in most cases this will mean there is no fixed size of Xs but this 
is not a requirement). You must include at least one such user story in this phase of the application along with three 
others of your choosing. Note that you will be allowed to modify and expand on your user stories as the term progresses 
and as the scope of your term project evolves.  So you should view this as a first iteration.
